# Check If Binary Tree Is Completed
_update Mar 4, 2018  1:18_

---
Check if a given binary tree is completed. A complete binary tree is one in which every level of the binary tree is completely filled except possibly the last level. Furthermore, all nodes are as far left as possible.

**Examples**

                5
        
              /    \
        
            3        8
        
          /   \
        
        1      4
        
        is completed.
        
                5
        
              /    \
        
            3        8
        
          /   \        \
        
        1      4        11
        
        is not completed.

**Corner Cases**

1. What if the binary tree is null?  
>  Return true in this case.
