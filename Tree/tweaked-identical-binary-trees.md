# Tweaked Identical Binary Trees
_update Mar 3, 2018 23:34_

----
Determine whether two given binary trees are identical assuming any number of ‘tweak’s are allowed. A tweak is defined as a swap of the children of one node in the tree.

**Examples**

                5
        
              /    \
        
            3        8
        
          /   \
        
        1      4

and

          5
  
        /    \
  
      8        3
  
             /   \
  
            1     4

the two binary trees are tweaked identical.
