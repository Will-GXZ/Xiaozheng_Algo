[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/description/)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (_ie, symmetric around its center_).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

         1
        / \
       2   2
      / \ / \
     3  4 4  3
     
But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:

        1
       / \
      2   2
       \   \
       3    3
       
**Note:**  
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
