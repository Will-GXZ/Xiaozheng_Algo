### View of memory:

Process 只能看到 logical pages，而 OS 则使用 physical memory maps；
(not finished)

### Cache
**A basic design principle:**  

* If a correspondence is large and sparse, use a hash.
* If a correspondence is large and dense, use a cache.
* If a correspondence is small, use an array.

**Influences upon memory addressing:**

1. Fragmentation: the fact that allocation patterns create holes in memory space.
2. Locality: the fact that most programs access memory with localized patterns of access; the likelihood that apage access will be followed by others is high.
3. Security: the fact that processes should not be able to
see other processes' space. 

#### Page Tables (IA32)
A page table keeps track of the correspondence between pages and frames. Each logical address is separated into a page number and an offset;

Page table 也有可能不能完全加载，在出现page table cache miss 的时候，会发生如下：

1. interrupt the OS
2. load a new page table cache entry.
3. continue

#### IA64 不用 page table，而是使用 translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
