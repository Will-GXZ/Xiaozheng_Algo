Process 只能看到 logical pages，而 OS 则使用 physical memory maps；

### Cache
**A basic design principle:**  

* If a correspondence is large and sparse, use a hash.
* If a correspondence is large and dense, use a cache.
* If a correspondence is small, use an array.

**Influences upon memory addressing:**

1. Fragmentation: the fact that allocation patterns create holes in memory space.
2. Locality: the fact that most programs access memory with localized patterns of access; the likelihood that apage access will be followed by others is high.
3. Security: the fact that processes should not be able to
see other processes' space.
